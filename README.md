export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs

source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

source ~/.profile

mkvirtualenv cv

Secondly, run the code by typing below:

%python face__detect_cv3.py your_img.jpg

python face_detect_cv3.py federer.jpg

Please check the Results file for discussion on the code and other related parameters.
